In this screenshot you can see the intake of tickets. Notice you can see the subject of the ticket, this will be a brief explanation of what issue the user is experiencing. From here you can access the ticket to see more detailed information about the issue, aswell as claiming the ticket, assigning the ticket, modifying the ticket and closing the ticket.

Next we have the base page of the ticket once you have accessed it. This page will show the status of the ticket (open or closed), the priority of the ticket, the department the ticket was assigned to, along with other basic information. Such as the date created, time created, who created it, the due date of the ticket. 

  - To begin working this ticket you may need to reply to the ticket to gather more information about the issue the user is experiencing. Once you have the information required you can work through the troubleshooting steps required for this specific issue.

<p>
Here is an example of a back and forth conversation with the user to have a better understanding of the issue. You can see that there are message logs that are saved to the chat on the ticket, this might be a typical example of what working through the ticket would look like. Once you have fully investigated the issue and you have come a solution you can change the status of the ticket. You would most likely be changing the status of the ticket to "resolved". To do that you would navigate back to the top of the ticket and select from the ticket status drop down menu.
